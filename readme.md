# Travel App

A native iOS travel app written in Swift that helps users discover destinations, plan trips, view maps, and access travel-related information. This README provides an overview, setup instructions, architectural notes, and guidance for contributors.

## Features
- Browse curated destinations and points of interest
- Interactive map view with location search
- Trip planning: create, edit and save itineraries
- Offline caching for previously loaded data and images
- Weather and travel tips for selected destinations (requires API)
- Location-based suggestions and directions
- Clean Swift codebase (MVVM / Coordinator-friendly structure)
- Unit and UI test targets scaffolded

(If your app currently implements a subset of features, remove unused items above.)

---

## Requirements
- Xcode 14.0+ (adjust if your project targets a different version)
- iOS 15.0+ (adjust per project settings)
- Swift 5.6+ (or the project Swift tools version)
- Optional: CocoaPods, Carthage or Swift Package Manager (if used in the project)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/phantomop26/travel-app.git
   cd travel-app

2. Dependencies
   - If the project uses Swift Package Manager (Recommended): open the `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` in Xcode and let SPM fetch packages.
   - If the project uses CocoaPods:
     - Install CocoaPods if needed: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
     - Install pods: `pod install`
     - Open the workspace: `open TravelApp.xcworkspace`
   - If the project uses Carthage: run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS`.

3. Open the Xcode workspace/project, choose a simulator or device, and build.

---

## Running the app

- In Xcode select the target `TravelApp` and choose a simulator (e.g., iPhone 14).
- Press CMD+R to build & run.
- Grant location permissions when prompted for full app functionality.

Debugging tips:
- Use the Xcode Console for logs.
- To test location-based features, use the Simulator > Features > Location presets.

---

## Configuration

Many travel apps integrate external services (maps, weather, places). Keep keys out of source control.

- Create a `.env` file or use Xcode configuration files to store secrets.
- Example environment keys:
  - `MAPS_API_KEY` — Maps provider (Google Maps or Mapbox) if used
  - `WEATHER_API_KEY` — Weather service (OpenWeatherMap, etc.)
  - `PLACES_API_KEY` — Places/POI API key

Add a `Config.sample.plist` (or `Env.sample`) file with the expected keys so developers know what to provide. Do NOT commit real keys.

Privacy & permissions:
- Update `Info.plist` with appropriate usage descriptions:
  - `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
  - `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` (if required)
  - `NSCameraUsageDescription` (if adding photo features)
  - `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (if allowing photo import)

## Architecture & Folder Structure

This repository follows common iOS best practices and is organized to be easy to navigate.

Suggested structure (adjust to match the repo):
- /App
  - AppDelegate.swift / SceneDelegate.swift
  - AppCoordinator.swift (if using Coordinators)
- /Sources
  - /Scenes (e.g., Home, Map, TripDetail)
  - /ViewModels
  - /Views / Cells
  - /Networking
  - /Models
  - /Services (LocationService, NetworkService, PersistenceService)
  - /Utilities
- /Resources
  - Assets.xcassets
  - Localizable.strings
- /Tests
  - UnitTests
  - UITests

Recommended patterns:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Coordinators for navigation
- Dependency injection for testability (e.g., protocol-driven services)
- Use Codable for JSON serialization
- Cache images using URLCache or third-party libraries (Kingfisher, Nuke)

---

## Persistence & Offline
- Use Core Data or Realm for structured offline storage (trips, saved destinations).
- For lightweight caching (images & API responses), consider URLCache + file-based cache.

---

## Testing
- Unit tests: Place logic tests under `Tests/UnitTests`.
- UI tests: Use `XCTest` UI tests under `Tests/UITests`.
- Run all tests:
  - From Xcode: Product → Test or CMD+U
  - CI: Configure `xcodebuild` commands for headless runs.

Example CI step:
- xcodebuild -workspace TravelApp.xcworkspace -scheme TravelApp -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14,OS=17.0' test

Adjust OS and simulator versions per your CI environment.

---

## Localization & Accessibility
- Localize strings with `Localizable.strings`.
- Use accessibility identifiers for important views to make UI tests more reliable.
- Respect Dynamic Type for fonts and ensure VoiceOver works across the app.

---

## Contributing
Thanks for considering contributing! A few guidelines:
- Open an issue for large feature requests before implementing.
- For bugfixes and small features, open a pull request against `main`.
- Follow the project's Swift style (prefer SwiftLint if included).
- Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes.

Pull Request checklist:
- [ ] Branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., feature/add-offline-cache)
- [ ] Include tests where applicable
- [ ] Update README or other docs for new behavior
- [ ] Ensure CI passes

---

## Roadmap
Planned improvements (example):
- Add onboarding walkthrough
- Improve offline sync & conflict resolution
- Add social sharing of itineraries
- Add Apple Watch companion app

If you'd like to prioritize or tackle an item, open an issue or a discussion.

Thank you for checking out Travel App! If you want, I can:
- generate a sample Config.sample.plist,
- add a CONTRIBUTING.md or CODE_OF_CONDUCT,
- scaffold GitHub Actions CI workflow for tests and linting,
- or create a minimal App icon and README screenshots section (please provide images or describe them).

What's next for me: I created this README.md tailored for a Swift iOS project and included placeholders and TODOs so you can quickly fill project-specific details. Tell me which optional pieces you'd like me to add (CI workflow, config file, license file, screenshots, or contribution docs) and I'll generate them.
